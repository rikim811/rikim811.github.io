    "1 Corinthians": {
      "1": "Paul, to the church in Corinth. Let there be no divisions. The cross is folly to those perishing, but to us it is the power of God.",
      "2": "I knew nothing among you except Christ crucified. We speak the wisdom of God. Through the Spirit we know what God has freely given.",
      "3": "You are still infants. One follows Paul, another Apollos. We are co-workers with God. Christ is the foundation. You are God's temple.",
      "4": "Think of us as stewards of the mysteries of God. You are kings already? We are fools for Christ. I admonish you as my dear children.",
      "5": "You boast about the sexual immorality among you. You should deliver that man to Satan. But I am not judging those outside the church.",
      "6": "Do you take one another to court? Why not rather be wronged? Your body is not for sexual immorality, it is a temple of the Spirit.",
      "7": "It is good to stay unmarried, but better to marry than to burn with lust. Each should live as God has called. I want you to be free.",
      "8": "About food offered to idols: An idol is nothing. There is only one God. But if food makes my brother stumble I will never eat meat.",
      "9": "You are the seal of my apostleship. Do we not have the right to material support? But I made myself a servant to all for the gospel.",
      "10": "Do not desire evil as our fathers did. God will make you able to endure temptation. Flee from idolatry. Do all to the glory of God.",
      "11": "The head of a woman is her husband. I hear that some go hungry when you meet! With the bread and cup you proclaim the Lord's death.",
      "12": "Now there are various spiritual gifts, but one Spirit. If the whole body were an eye, how would it hear? You are the body of Christ.",
      "13": "Without love I am nothing. Love is patient, does not boast, endures all things. Tongues will cease, but faith, hope and love remain.",
      "14": "Tongues edify the speaker, prophecy edifies the church. Each of you brings a hymn, a lesson or a tongue. Let all be done in order.",
      "15": "Christ was raised from the dead. If not then your faith is futile. But he is the firstfruits. At the trumpet we will all be changed.",
      "16": "Put aside an offering for the saints. I will come to you. The churches of Asia greet you. The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you."
