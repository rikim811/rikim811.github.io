      "1": "Peter, to the diaspora. God has given us new birth through Christ. The prophets told of this grace. So be holy in all your conduct.",
      "2": "You are being built up to be a royal priesthood. Submit to human authority. Live as servants of God. Follow Christ in his suffering.",
      "3": "Wives, submit to your husbands. Husbands, honour your wives. Repay evil with blessing. Christ suffered for sins to bring us to God.",
      "4": "Do not live for human desires but for the will of God. The end is near. Love each other deeply. Do not be surprised when trials come.",
      "5": "Elders should be examples to the flock. Clothe yourselves with humility. Resist the devil. God will strengthen you. Peace to you all."
