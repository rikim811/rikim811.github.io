      "1": "Paul, to the saints in Philippi. I thank God for you. My imprisonment has advanced the gospel. To live is Christ and to die is gain.",
      "2": "Have the mind of Christ, who humbled himself even to a cross. Work out your salvation with trembling. I hope to send Timothy to you.",
      "3": "We put no confidence in the flesh. I count all things as loss compared to Christ. I press on towards the prize. Brothers, imitate me.",
      "4": "Rejoice in the Lord always! The peace of God will guard your hearts. I rejoice at your concern for me. My God will supply your needs."
