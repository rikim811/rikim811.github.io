    "Proverbs": {
      "1": "The proverbs of Solomon. My son, if sinners entice you, do not consent. Wisdom calls aloud. The complacency of fools destroys them.",
      "2": "My son, apply your heart to understanding. For the LORD gives wisdom. It will save you from the way of evil, and from the adulteress.",
      "3": "My son, trust in the LORD with all your heart. Do not despise his discipline. Wisdom is a tree of life. Do not quarrel without cause.",
      "4": "Listen, my sons: Get wisdom. The path of the righteous is like the morning sun. Guard your heart, for it is the wellspring of life.",
      "5": "My son, listen to my words. In the end an adulteress is bitter as wormwood. Keep away from her. Rejoice in the wife of your youth.",
      "6": "A little slumber, and poverty will come like a bandit. A scoundrel sows discord. My son, a man who commits adultery destroys himself.",
      "7": "My son, wisdom will keep you from the adulteress. I saw her seducing a young man. He followed her like an ox going to the slaughter.",
      "8": "Wisdom cries aloud: 'My mouth speaks truth. The LORD brought me forth at the beginning of his works. Whoever finds me finds life.'",
      "9": "Wisdom has built her house. She says, 'Come, leave your folly.' The fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom. Folly knows nothing.",
      "10": "A wise son makes a glad father. Love covers all offences. With many words, sin is not lacking. The righteous will never be uprooted.",
      "11": "The LORD hates dishonest scales. The wicked earn false wages. Whoever gives water will get water. Whoever trusts in riches will fall.",
      "12": "No one finds security by wickedness. Those who work the land have food. Rash words pierce like a sword. Righteousness leads to life.",
      "13": "The righteous hate lies. Hope deferred makes the heart sick. Whoever heeds reproof is honoured. Whoever spares the rod hates his son.",
      "14": "The talk of fools is a rod for their backs. Even in laughter the heart may ache. Those who oppress the poor insult their Maker.",
      "15": "A gentle answer turns away wrath. The eyes of the LORD are everywhere. Plans fail for lack of counsel. The LORD hears the righteous.",
      "16": "A man plans his way, but the LORD directs his steps. Kings detest evil. Pride goes before destruction. Wisdom is a fountain of life.",
      "17": "A wise servant will rule over a shameful son. Starting a quarrel is like breaching a dam. Even a fool seems wise if he keeps silent.",
      "18": "A fool delights in his own opinions. The name of the LORD is a strong tower. A gift opens the way. The tongue can bring life or death.",
      "19": "Wealth makes friends. A false witness will not go unpunished. A good wife is from the LORD. Whoever helps the poor lends to the LORD.",
      "20": "Wine is a mocker, beer a brawler. Even a child is known by his deeds. The LORD hates false weights. It is a snare to make rash vows.",
      "21": "To do justice is better than sacrifice. Better to live on the roof than with a quarrelsome wife. No plans can avail against the LORD.",
      "22": "A good name is better than riches. Train a child and he will not go astray. Incline your ear and apply your heart to my teaching.",
      "23": "Do not wear yourself out to get rich. Do not move a boundary marker. Buy the truth, and do not sell it. Do not linger long over wine.",
      "24": "Do not envy the wicked. Wisdom is sweet to the soul. Fear the LORD and the king, my son. I saw thorns in the field of the sluggard.",
      "25": "Do not exalt yourself in the king's presence. If your enemy is hungry, give him food to eat. To seek one's own glory is not glory.",
      "26": "As a dog returns to its vomit, so a fool repeats his folly. Without gossip a quarrel dies down. Whoever digs a pit will fall into it.",
      "27": "Faithful are the wounds of a friend. A loud blessing in the morning will be taken as a curse. A person is tested by being praised.",
      "28": "Better to be poor and honest than crooked and rich. Whoever confesses sins will find mercy. Whoever trusts in the LORD will prosper.",
      "29": "By justice a king builds up the land. Whether a fool rages or laughs, there is no peace. Correct your son and he will give you rest.",
      "30": "Every word of God is pure. Give me neither poverty nor riches. Four things are never satisfied: Sheol, a barren womb, earth and fire.",
      "31": "Speak up for the speechless. Who can find an excellent wife? She buys a field, she makes garments, she watches over her household."
