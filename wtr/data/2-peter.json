    "2 Peter": {
      "1": "Peter, to those of faith. God has given us great promises. So supplement faith with virtue and love. We were eyewitnesses of Christ.",
      "2": "False teachers will arise. If God did not spare angels, then he knows how to punish the unrighteous. They are slaves of corruption.",
      "3": "Scoffers will say, 'Where is his return?' The Lord is not slow, but patient. Untaught people twist the Scriptures. Grow in Christ."
