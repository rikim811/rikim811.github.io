    "2 Corinthians": {
      "1": "Paul, to the church in Corinth. We share in Christ's sufferings and comfort. My yes is not no, but to spare you I did not visit you.",
      "2": "I wrote to you as I did in much anguish. You should forgive the one who caused you pain. Through us God spreads the aroma of Christ.",
      "3": "God has made us ministers of a new covenant. When anyone turns to the Lord, the veil is lifted. We are being transformed into glory.",
      "4": "God has given us the light of the glory of Christ. We have this treasure in clay jars. Through affliction we look to what is eternal.",
      "5": "What is mortal will be clothed with life. If anyone is in Christ, the new creation has come. We implore you, be reconciled to God!",
      "6": "Now is the day of salvation. We commend ourselves as servants. Do not be yoked with unbelievers. We are the temple of the living God.",
      "7": "I take great pride in you. I do not regret my letter, for godly grief produces repentance. Our boasts about you to Titus proved true.",
      "8": "The churches of Macedonia have given generously for the saints. See that you excel in this grace too. Titus was eager to go to you.",
      "9": "I boast to the Macedonians about the gift you promised. God loves a cheerful giver. Your generosity will overflow in thanksgivings.",
      "10": "Our weapons destroy arguments against God. What we say by letter we do in person. We only boast within the sphere God has given us.",
      "11": "I am jealous for you against these false apostles. I speak as a fool. Do they boast? I have greater labours, beatings and dangers.",
      "12": "I will boast of a man who saw paradise. I was given a thorn to keep me from pride. This is foolish! I will gladly be spent for you.",
      "13": "This will be my third visit. Christ is powerful among you. Test that you are in the faith. Be mature. The grace of God be with you."
