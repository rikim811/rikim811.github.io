    "2 Thessalonians": {
      "1": "Paul, Silvanus and Timothy, to the Thessalonians. We boast of your faith through persecution. The Lord Jesus will appear in vengeance.",
      "2": "Do not be alarmed about the day of the Lord. First the lawless one will appear, whom Jesus will destroy. Hold fast to our traditions.",
      "3": "Finally, pray for us. The Lord will guard you against the evil one. Keep away from anyone who walks in idleness. The Lord be with you."
