      "1": "James, to the tribes. Many trials produce perseverance. Riches will fade. Every good gift comes from the Father. Be doers of the word.",
      "2": "If you show partiality to the rich you are committing sin. Act as those who are under the law of liberty. Faith without works is dead.",
      "3": "No one can tame the tongue. With it we bless our Father and with it we curse others. The wisdom from above is pure and peace-loving.",
      "4": "Your worldly desires cause conflict. Resist the devil, draw near to God. Who are you to judge your neighbour? You boast in arrogance.",
      "5": "You rich have fattened yourselves for slaughter. Brothers, be patient until the Lord comes. The prayer of faith will save the sick."
