      "1": "The LORD sent Jonah to Nineveh. Jonah fled by ship. A storm arose and the men threw Jonah into the sea. A great fish swallowed him.",
      "2": "Jonah prayed: 'I cried out in my distress. Waters surrounded me. You brought me up from the pit!' The fish vomited him onto dry land.",
      "3": "So Jonah went to Nineveh and said, 'Nineveh shall be overthrown!' The people fasted and wore sackcloth. God relented of the disaster.",
      "4": "Jonah was angry and said, 'O LORD, take my life.' A plant sheltered Jonah but it died. The LORD said, 'Should I not pity Nineveh?'"
