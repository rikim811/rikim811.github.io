    "2 Timothy": {
      "1": "Paul, to Timothy my son. Fan into flame the gift of God. Share in suffering for the gospel. Hold to the standard of sound teaching.",
      "2": "No soldier gets entangled with civilian affairs. Present yourself to God as an approved worker. Cleanse yourself for honourable use.",
      "3": "In the last days people will be proud and unholy. As for you, continue in what you have learned. All Scripture is inspired by God.",
      "4": "Preach the word in and out of season. I have finished my race. Come to me soon with Mark. Beware of Alexander. The Lord be with you."
