    "Deuteronomy": {
      "1": "We journeyed from Horeb. You would not go up to take the land, so the LORD said, 'This generation will not see it.'",
      "2": "We went into the wilderness. Thirty-eight years passed, then the LORD told us to cross by Moab. He delivered Sihon the Amorite to us.",
      "3": "The LORD delivered Og of Bashan to us. I gave Gilead to Reuben, Gad and Manasseh. The LORD said that I would not cross into the land.",
      "4": "Now, Israel, hear the commandments and obey them. You heard the LORD speak from the fire. Take care not to make idols. The LORD is God.",
      "5": "The LORD made his covenant with us: Have no other gods; Keep the Sabbath; Honour your parents. You shall do all that he has commanded.",
      "6": "Hear, O Israel: The LORD our God is one. Love the LORD with all your heart, soul and strength. Teach your children these commandments.",
      "7": "Make no treaty with the nations of the land. You are a holy people, the LORD has chosen you. He will drive out the nations before you.",
      "8": "The LORD led you in the wilderness and tested you. He is bringing you into a good land. Do not forget the LORD or you shall perish.",
      "9": "It is not for your righteousness that you will occupy the land. You rebelled and made the calf so I broke the tablets of the covenant.",
      "10": "The LORD wrote on new tablets. What does the LORD ask? That you fear him, walk in his ways, love him, serve him and keep his commands.",
      "11": "You have seen all that the LORD has done. Keep these commands so that you may live long in the land. There is a blessing and a curse.",
      "12": "Destroy the high places where the nations worship their gods. You shall bring your offerings at the place that the LORD will choose.",
      "13": "If a prophet or anyone else entices you away from the LORD they must be put to death. If a town has turned away it must be destroyed.",
      "14": "You may eat animals with cloven hooves that chew the cud. Bring a tithe from your fields to eat before the LORD and for the Levites.",
      "15": "Every seven years you shall cancel debts. Hebrew slaves shall go free in the seventh year. Set apart every firstborn male animal.",
      "16": "Celebrate the Passover in the month of Abib. Celebrate the Feast of Weeks and the Feast of Booths. Appoint judges in all your towns.",
      "17": "Anyone who breaks the covenant shall be put to death. Go to the priests with hard decisions. Appoint the king that the LORD chooses.",
      "18": "The priests shall eat the offerings made by fire. You shall not practise divination. The LORD will raise up a prophet from among you.",
      "19": "Set aside three cities so that anyone who kills accidently may flee there. A matter must be established by two or three witnesses.",
      "20": "When you go to war, do not be afraid; the LORD is with you. As you go to attack a city, offer terms, except to the cities of the land.",
      "21": "If a dead body is found, the city elders must cleanse the guilt. Give your eldest son his portion. A rebellious son shall be stoned.",
      "22": "If you find your neighbour's ox you shall return it. If a man falsely claims that his new wife was not a virgin he shall be punished.",
      "23": "No Ammonite shall enter the assembly of the LORD. When you go out to war the camp must be holy. Be careful to do what you have vowed.",
      "24": "If a man divorces his wife he must not remarry her. Do not withhold wages. Leave the gleanings of your harvest for widows and orphans.",
      "25": "A judge may give up to forty lashes. If a man dies and has no son, his brother shall marry his widow. You shall have honest weights.",
      "26": "Bring the firstfruits of the land to the LORD. Bring a tithe in the third year and say to the LORD, 'Look down and bless your people.'",
      "27": "Write the law on large stones. The Levites will say, 'Cursed is anyone who does not keep the law,' and the people will reply, 'Amen.'",
      "28": "If you obey the LORD he will bless you above all nations; if not, you will be cursed and the LORD will send a nation to destroy you.",
      "29": "You have seen all that the LORD has done so keep this covenant. If you break it the land will be cursed and the LORD will uproot you.",
      "30": "When you return to the LORD he will have compassion; he will circumcise your heart. I have set before you life and death. Choose life.",
      "31": "Joshua will cross ahead of you. Read the law every seven years. The LORD said, 'The people will turn away. Write a song as a witness.'",
      "32": "Ascribe greatness to our God! The LORD's portion is his people; They turned away so he spurned them; But he will provide atonement.",
      "33": "Moses blessed Israel before his death: Let Reuben live; bless Levi's work; Joseph's land is blessed. The eternal God is your refuge.",
      "34": "Moses climbed Mount Nebo. There the LORD showed him the promised land. Then Moses died. No prophet has arisen in Israel like Moses."
