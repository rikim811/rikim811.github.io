      "1": "How lonely sits the city! Judah has gone into exile. O LORD, I am despised. Is any sorrow like mine? There is no one to comfort me.",
      "2": "The LORD has not pitied Jacob. He has abandoned his sanctuary. My eyes fail with tears. Young and old lie slaughtered in the streets.",
      "3": "He has driven me into darkness. But the steadfast love of the LORD never ceases. Let us return to the LORD! You will repay my enemies.",
      "4": "The holy stones lie scattered. The children beg for food. The LORD has poured out his fierce anger. O Zion, your punishment will end.",
      "5": "Look, O LORD, and see our disgrace! We have become orphans. Slaves rule over us. But you, O LORD, reign forever. Restore us as of old!"
