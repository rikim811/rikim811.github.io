    "Amos": {
      "1": "The LORD says: 'I will punish Damascus. The remnant of the Philistines shall perish. I will send fire upon Tyre, Edom and Ammon.'",
      "2": "'I will send fire upon Moab and Judah. I will punish Israel. They sell the poor for a pair of sandals. The mighty shall flee naked.'",
      "3": "Does a lion roar when it has no prey? The LORD reveals his plans to the prophets. 'On the day I punish Israel, I will punish Bethel.'",
      "4": "'You cows of Bashan will be led away with hooks. I withheld the rain. I overthrew some of you. Prepare to meet your God, O Israel!'",
      "5": "'Fallen is virgin Israel. Seek me and live. You shall not dwell in your houses. I despise your feasts. Let justice roll like waters.'",
      "6": "Woe to those who are at ease in Zion, who are not grieved over Joseph. The LORD declares: 'I will raise up a nation against you.'",
      "7": "The LORD showed me locusts, fire and a plumb line. Amaziah told Amos, 'Flee to Judah.' Amos said, 'You shall die in an unclean land.'",
      "8": "The LORD said: 'The end has come upon Israel. I will not forget your deeds. I will send a famine of hearing the words of the LORD.'",
      "9": "The LORD said: 'Strike the pillars until the earth shakes. I will sieve the house of Israel. In that day I will restore my people.'"
