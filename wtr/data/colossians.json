    "Colossians": {
      "1": "Paul, to the saints in Colossae. May you be filled with wisdom. The Son is the image of the invisible God. I make known the mystery.",
      "2": "Let no one deceive you. You were buried with Christ and also raised with him. Why do you follow rules that do not restrain the flesh?",
      "3": "Seek the things above. Your life is hidden with Christ in God. So put to death your worldliness. Do everything in the name of Jesus.",
      "4": "Devote yourselves to prayer. Let your speech be gracious. Tychicus will tell you our news. Aristarchus, Mark, and Epaphras greet you."
