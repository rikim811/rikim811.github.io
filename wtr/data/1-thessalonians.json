    "1 Thessalonians": {
      "1": "Paul, Silvanus, and Timothy, to the Thessalonians. We give thanks for you. Our gospel came in power. Your faith is an example to all.",
      "2": "We shared the gospel with you and also our lives. You suffered like the churches in Judea. We tried to see you. Are you not our crown?",
      "3": "We sent Timothy to strengthen you. We warned you that persecution would come. We are encouraged by your faith. May you grow in love.",
      "4": "Live to please God. Avoid immorality. Love one another more and more. We do not grieve without hope, for the dead in Christ will rise.",
      "5": "The day of the Lord will come like a thief. Let us keep awake. Honour those who lead you. Do not quench the Spirit. Grace be with you."
