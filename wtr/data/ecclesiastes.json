    "Ecclesiastes": {
      "1": "Everything is meaningless! There is nothing new under the sun. I applied my heart to know wisdom, but much wisdom brings much sorrow.",
      "2": "I built houses, gathered possessions and sought pleasure. It was meaningless! The wise die like the foolish. I despaired of my toil.",
      "3": "There is a time for everything: to live, to die, to mourn, to dance. It is the gift of God that man should find pleasure in his work.",
      "4": "I saw the tears of the oppressed. Two have a good reward for their toil. I saw everyone follow a new king. This too is meaningless!",
      "5": "Do not make rash vows before God. The lover of money never has enough. What is gained by toil? It is good to find enjoyment in life.",
      "6": "Here is an evil: to have wealth and honour but not to enjoy them. What do the wise gain over fools? The more words, the less meaning.",
      "7": "The heart of the wise is in the house of mourning. Do not be too righteous, or too wicked. Men have gone in search of many schemes.",
      "8": "Obey the king's command. Though sinners do evil, it will be well for those who fear God. No one can know what goes on under the sun.",
      "9": "The same fate comes to all. A living dog is better than a dead lion. Enjoy the days of your vain life. Wisdom is better than strength.",
      "10": "A little folly spoils wisdom. Whoever digs a pit will fall into it. The lips of a fool consume him. Through laziness the roof leaks.",
      "11": "Whoever watches the clouds will never reap. You do not know what will prosper. Enjoy your youth, but know that God will judge you.",
      "12": "Remember your Creator in your youth, before the days of trouble come. Everything is meaningless! Fear God and keep his commandments."
