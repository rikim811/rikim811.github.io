    "Micah": {
      "1": "The LORD is coming! The mountains will melt. 'I will make Samaria a ruin.' Her wound is incurable. Disaster has come to Jerusalem.",
      "2": "Woe to those who plot evil! The LORD says: 'I am planning disaster. My people have risen up like an enemy. I will gather a remnant.'",
      "3": "You rulers tear the skin from my people. The LORD says, 'The sun will set for the prophets.' Zion will be ploughed up like a field.",
      "4": "In the last days, nations will come to the mountain of the LORD. Zion will be rescued from Babylon. 'I will give you horns of iron.'",
      "5": "'From you, O Bethlehem, will come a ruler.' The remnant of Jacob will be like a lion. 'I will punish the nations that did not obey.'",
      "6": "'O my people, have I wearied you?' What does the LORD require? Act justly and love mercy. 'I will make you desolate for your sins.'",
      "7": "The godly have perished from the earth. But I will look to the LORD. The nations will tremble. Who is a God like you, forgiving sin?"
