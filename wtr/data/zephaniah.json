      "1": "'I will sweep away everything from the earth,' declares the LORD. The day of the LORD is near. 'I will bring distress on mankind.'",
      "2": "Seek the LORD, you humble. Gaza shall be deserted. The LORD is against you, O Canaan. He will stretch out his hand to destroy Assyria.",
      "3": "Woe to the rebellious city! 'I have cut off nations. I will leave a humble people.' Sing, O Zion! The LORD will quiet you by his love."
