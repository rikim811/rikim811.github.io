    "Galatians": {
      "1": "Paul, to the churches of Galatia. You are already turning to a different gospel! The gospel I preached came by revelation from Christ.",
      "2": "I went up to Jerusalem and saw the leaders. I opposed Cephas about circumcision. We are justified by faith in Christ and not by works.",
      "3": "Those who are of faith are blessed with Abraham. Christ has redeemed us from the curse of the law. In Christ you are all sons of God.",
      "4": "God sent his Son for us to receive adoption. How can you turn back to worthless principles? You, like Isaac, are children of promise.",
      "5": "Christ has set us free. Circumcision counts for nothing. Use your freedom to love one another. Walk by the Spirit and not the flesh.",
      "6": "Restore anyone caught in sin. Sow to the Spirit and reap eternal life. Let us not give up doing good. What counts is the new creation."
