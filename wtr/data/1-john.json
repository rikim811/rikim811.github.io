    "1 John": {
      "1": "We have seen and proclaim to you the Word of life. God is light. If we walk in the light, the blood of Jesus cleanses us from all sin.",
      "2": "We know Christ if we keep his commands. Whoever loves his brother lives in the light. Do not love the world. Children, abide in him.",
      "3": "We are God's children. Those born of God do not sin. We should love one another. We know love because he laid down his life for us.",
      "4": "Any spirit that confesses Christ is of God. God is love. He sent his Son as a sacrifice for sins. If we live in love, God lives in us.",
      "5": "Anyone born of God overcomes the world. The Spirit, water and blood all testify. God gave us eternal life in his Son. Keep from idols."
