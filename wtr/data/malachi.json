      "1": "'I have loved you,' says the LORD. 'Where is my honour? You offer blind and lame sacrifices. My name will be great among the nations.'",
      "2": "'Now, O priests, I will curse you. You have corrupted the covenant of Levi.' Judah has profaned the sanctuary. The LORD hates divorce.",
      "3": "'My messenger will prepare the way. I will come to judge. You have robbed me of tithes. The LORD will remember those who serve him.'",
      "4": "'The day is coming like a furnace. The sun of righteousness will rise. The wicked will be ashes. I will send you Elijah the prophet.'"
